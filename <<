> `cat <<EOF` followed by several lines of text, followed by the literal string `EOF` on a new line, NOT indented. The portion between the `EOF`s is passed to the command as standard input. If `'EOF'` is 'quoted', substitutions WON'T be done; otherwise they are. See `<<-` for the indented variety (not recommended, need TABs).
