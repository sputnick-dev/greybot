    command < <(othercommand)

Same thing as

    othercommand | command

but without subshelling 'command'. Uses file redirection `<` to redirect a file created by process substitution `<()`. The space between `<` and `<( )` is important to avoid ambiguity (is it a heredoc, is it a redirected PS?).
