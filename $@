The difference between `$@` and `$*`: Without quotes (don't do this!), there is no difference. With double quotes, `"$@"` expands to each positional parameter as its own argument: `"$1" "$2"` ..., while `"$*"` expands to the single argument `"$1c$2c..."`, where '`c`' is the first character of `IFS`. You almost always want `"$@"` (QUOTED!). The same goes for arrays: `"${array[@]}"`.
