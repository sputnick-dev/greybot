The `=~` operator of `[[` evaluates the left hand string against the right hand extended regular expression (`ERE`). After a successful match, `BASH_REMATCH` can be used to expand matched groups from the pattern. Quoted parts of the regex become literal. To be safe & compatible, put the regex in a variable and do

    [[ $string =~ $regex ]]
