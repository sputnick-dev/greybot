seq(1) is nonstandard, inefficient and useless. For bash2.04+/zsh/ksh93, use for ((i = 1; i <= 10; i++)); do ..., for POSIX and other shells, see !counting

For brace expansion {0..n}, that is a zshism (since copied by many other shells) is less efficient than `seq n` for large values of n (where efficiency matters), as it implies storing the whole list of numbers (as strings converted from numbers likely through some `sprintf()` call internally) in memory several times. Compare `time bash -c 'seq 10000000' > /dev/null` with `time bash -c 'printf "%s\n" {1..10000000}' > /dev/null` [see here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/739795/print-odd-numbered-lines-starting-with-the-first-line/739808?noredirect=1#comment1404879_739808)
